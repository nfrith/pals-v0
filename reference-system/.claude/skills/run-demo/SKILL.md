# run-demo

Demo runner for the reference-system. Injects demo-mode overrides into delamain agents, starts one traffic generator per delamain, then starts dispatchers — so every delamain has work from the moment it comes online.

## Procedure

### 1. Inject demo-mode overrides

Run the injection script to add demo-mode instructions to all delamain agent files. This makes agents sleep 5 seconds and advance instead of doing real work.

```
Bash(command: "{skill-dir}/inject-demo-mode.sh")
```

Where `{skill-dir}` is the absolute path to this skill's directory (the directory containing this SKILL.md).

### 2. Start the traffic generators

Start one background shell per delamain — true process-level parallelism. The traffic generator accepts a `module/delamain` argument to filter to a single delamain.

First, run `bun install` once:

```
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun install --silent 2>/dev/null")
```

Then start all 5 generators in parallel (one `Bash(run_in_background: true)` call per delamain, all in a single message):

```
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun run src/index.ts experiments/run-lifecycle", run_in_background: true)
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun run src/index.ts factory/development-pipeline", run_in_background: true)
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun run src/index.ts incident-response/incident-lifecycle", run_in_background: true)
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun run src/index.ts postmortems/postmortem-lifecycle", run_in_background: true)
Bash(command: "cd {skill-dir}/dispatcher && bun run src/index.ts infra/release-lifecycle", run_in_background: true)
```

Wait ~5 seconds for the generators to start, then proceed.

### 3. Start dispatchers

Invoke the `als:run-delamains` skill to start all dispatchers:

```
Skill(skill: "als:run-delamains")
```

Every dispatcher will find items waiting on its first scan.

### 4. Report

Tell the operator:
- How many delamains were discovered
- That 5 traffic generators are running continuously in the background
- They can watch items flow via module operator consoles (e.g., `/factory-operate`)
- The generators stop when the Claude session ends

## Notes

- Demo items are real ALS records — they flow through the full state machine identically to production items.
- The traffic generator uses sonnet model with a $1.00 budget cap per seed (assumes subscription usage).
- Each delamain gets its own dedicated generator process for true parallelism.
- To watch the demo in action, open the module operator console in another pane.
- The generator logs each seed to stdout: `[run-demo] #N seeding module/delamain: "title"`
