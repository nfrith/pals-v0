# Changelog

All notable changes to ALS preview releases should be recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Added required module `description` fields to `.als/system.ts` declarations and validation.
- Accepted and documented SDR 026 for system-level module descriptions and the hard-break migration.
- Added first-class Delamain support to the ALS compiler:
  - `type: delamain` fields bound through a module `delamains` registry
  - Delamain bundle loading, graph validation, and state-owned agent validation
  - implicit resumable `session-field` synthesis on effective entity schemas
- Accepted and documented SDR 018 and SDR 020 as the current Delamain contract.
- Merged the former `software-factory` example fixture into `reference-system/`, which now carries the Delamain design and compiler reference surface.
- Extended `alsc deploy claude` from skill-only projection to full Claude projection:
  - active skills still project to `.claude/skills/`
  - bound Delamain bundles now project to `.claude/delamains/`
  - deploy now reports Delamain target collisions and flat-name conflicts
- Added compiler and deploy test coverage for Delamain validation and Claude projection behavior.
