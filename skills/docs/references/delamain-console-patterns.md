# Delamain Console Patterns

Reference for building operator console skills that work with any delamain. The console is a projection of the delamain's transition graph into an operator-friendly interface.

## Dependencies

Every console skill declares its dependencies in a `# Dependencies` section at the top of its SKILL.md, above the skill's title H1 and before the attention-queue scan section. Dependencies are split into two required sub-sections:

### Scanner results

Pre-processor block(s) that run at skill load time using the `!` technique available to SKILL.md files — `` !`bash-command` `` on its own line. Each check emits a clear token so downstream logic and the operator-agent can branch on it: e.g. `TOKEN_NAME: OK` on success, `MISSING_TOKEN: <actionable hint>` on failure. Use this for every environment-level prerequisite that can be verified statically — credential files present and populated, required binaries on PATH, external services reachable, script-local state files initialised.

### LLM Operations

Runtime dependency checks the operator-agent (Claude, inside the console session) performs before proceeding with any action. Use this for checks that require judgment or agent tools: dispatcher health (is a status file present and fresh?), write-access verification against factory directories, decisions about soft dependencies, and structured reactions to `MISSING_*` tokens emitted by Scanner results.

A console skill with failing Scanner results (any `MISSING_*` token) should refuse to proceed and surface the miss to the operator with a remediation hint. LLM Operations checks run every time the console is invoked, before the attention queue scan. Keep both sub-sections present even when empty — state "none" explicitly rather than omitting the sub-section.

## The Universal Operator Action Pattern

Every operator state in a delamain means the same thing: the system is waiting for operator input. The console actions are universal across all operator states.

### Actions

When the operator selects an {entity} in an operator-owned state, the console reads the delamain's transitions where `from` = current state, groups them by class, and presents:

| Action | Description | When shown |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Review** | Present the entity to the operator for reading | Always |
| **Respond** | Do the state-specific work, then choose a transition | If any advance or rework transitions exist |
| **Terminal** (shelve, cancel, etc.) | Exit the pipeline | If exit transitions exist for this state |
| **Exit** | Exit the console | Always |
| **Other** | Freeform operator instruction | Always |

If a class has zero targets for this state, omit that row entirely.

### Respond: two-phase pattern

"Respond" is a single action with two phases:

**Phase 1 — Do the work.** The operator performs whatever the state requires. The meaning depends on whether the state is initial:

| State kind | Phase 1 means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Initial** (`initial: true`) | Confirm ready to enter pipeline. |
| **Non-initial** | Perform what the preceding agent requires — answer questions, record test results, provide context. |

For non-initial states, the console determines what the operator is responding to by reading the entity's current content — agent questions in a questions section, test instructions in a test section, etc.

**Phase 1 is guided, not delegated.** The console walks the operator through the work step by step — presenting one item at a time, collecting responses, running verification where possible. The agent is an active partner during Phase 1, not a questionnaire that hands the operator a checklist and waits. For example: UAT testing presents each test case individually, helps verify results, and records outcomes as they happen. Input states present each question one at a time, collect answers, and ask follow-ups for clarity.

**Phase 2 — Choose direction.** After the work is done, the console presents the legal transitions from the delamain:

| Transition class | Presented as |
|------------------|-------------|
| **advance** | Advance to {state} — one option per advance target |
| **rework** | Rework to {state} — one option per rework target |

If a class has multiple targets (e.g., the initial state advances to three different states depending on entity type), show one option per target. If a class has zero targets, omit it.

The operator chooses the direction *after* doing the work, not before. This matters most for states where the response determines the outcome (e.g., UAT — pass vs fail isn't known until tests are performed).

### After every transition

Update the delamain's state as the last edit before the transition commit. Always.

Commit every transition as its own dedicated commit. Use the subject:

`delamain: <id> <from> → <to> [operator]`

The dispatcher only reads committed `HEAD` state. Unstaged or staged status edits do nothing until that transition commit exists.

### Review

"Review" means presenting the full entity record to the operator for reading before they make a decision.

The pattern is **platform-aware**: every console skill must detect the operator's platform via `$CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` (see [`platforms.md`](platforms.md)) and route to a platform-appropriate viewer. The console decides *how* to present; the contract is that the operator can always read the entity before acting.

| Platform | Entrypoint | Viewer pattern |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| [`ALS-PLAT-CCLI`](platforms.md) | `cli` | Terminal-native: tmux popup, `$PAGER`, or inline Read |
| [`ALS-PLAT-CDSK`](platforms.md) | `claude-desktop` | Ask the operator (via AskUserQuestion) whether they want to review in a browser. If yes, open the entity using whichever browser/preview MCP the operator has connected (e.g. Claude Preview, Claude in Chrome, or any successor). If no, present inline via Read. |
| [`ALS-PLAT-CWEB`](platforms.md) | `remote` | Ask as with CDSK; fall back to inline Read |
| [`ALS-PLAT-CCWK`](platforms.md) | *(unknown)* | Cowork-native viewer when implementation lands; fall back to inline Read until then |

When a preference question is appropriate (CDSK, CWEB), only ask once per review — if the operator already answered earlier in the same action flow, respect that choice for the rest of the flow.

The universal pattern does not prescribe a specific tool — neither a specific terminal viewer (`tmux-review`, `less`, `glow`, etc.) nor a specific browser MCP (Claude Preview, Claude in Chrome, or any successor). Each console skill chooses the concrete implementation based on what ships with the factory or system it belongs to. Factories intended for distribution outside their authoring repo must bundle or gracefully degrade so their Review action works without external dependencies. Do not hard-code specific MCP tool names in the pattern — tool naming on the browser side is expected to drift as Anthropic evolves the surface; rely on whichever browser/preview tool the operator has connected at run time.

## The Attention Queue

The attention queue is the console's entry screen — what the operator sees when they first open the console. It is not a delamain state or phase. It is a separate mode: a scan of all entities that need operator action.

### Scan

Read all entities. Filter to those whose status maps to an operator-owned state in the delamain. Group by state.

### Presentation

The attention queue is a selection prompt with two kinds of options:

1. **Create new {entity}** — always the first option, always shown, even when the queue is empty.
2. **Attention items** — entities in operator-owned states. Suggested label format: `[{STATE}] {id}  {title}` (e.g., `[UAT] GF-002  Upgrade tmux-annotate`).

The operator selects an item to act on (entering the universal action pattern), or creates a new entity. "Create new {entity}" only appears on the attention queue screen — once the operator selects an item, they are in the action pattern, not the queue.

### Loop

After every action completes, the console returns to the attention queue. Re-scan, re-present. The operator stays in the console until they exit or no items remain.

## Delamain-Driven vs Hand-Coded

A hand-coded console defines a switch statement per operator state with custom actions for each. This works for small delamains but scales poorly — every new operator state requires new console code.

A delamain-driven console reads the transition table and derives actions dynamically. The console skill only needs to know:

1. Which transitions are legal from this state (from the delamain)
2. What "respond" means for this state (from the entity's content)
3. How to present the entity for review (platform-specific)

State-specific behavior (like type-gated advance options for the initial state) is expressed through the delamain's transition rules, not through console branching logic.

## Example: Ghost Factory

Four operator states, one universal pattern:

| State | Initial? | Phase 1 (do the work) | Phase 2 (choose direction) |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `drafted` | yes | Confirm ready to enter pipeline | Advance to research, planning, or dev (type-gated) |
| `research-input` | no | Answer research agent questions | Advance to planning / Rework to research |
| `plan-input` | no | Answer planner agent questions | Advance to dev / Rework to planning |
| `uat` | no | Perform tests, record results | Advance to done / Rework to dev |

The console doesn't know about these states specifically. It reads the delamain, sees what's legal, and presents the universal action menu. The only state-specific knowledge is what phase 1 means — and that comes from reading the entity, not from console code.
