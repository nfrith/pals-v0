# Delamain State Agents

## Status

Proposed

## Context

- SDR 018 proposes Delamain as ALS's phase-constrained transition graph construct.
- SDR 019 explored prompt assets bound one-to-one to transition outcomes.
- The software-factory fixture exposed a mismatch: dispatch happens because an item is currently in a state, not because the system already knows which branch the item will take out of that state.
- Planning is the clearest example. A planning agent is dispatched because the item is in `planning`, then chooses whether the result is `plan-input` or `plan-ready`.
- The same pattern appears in review and deployment verification. One active state leads to several possible legal outcomes chosen by the work performed in that state.
- Prompt assets therefore align more naturally with current states than with pre-selected transition edges.

## Decision

- ALS adds a first draft `agents` construct scoped inside a Delamain bundle.
- Delamain-local agents are bound to states, not to transitions, in this pass.
- A non-terminal state declares `actor: operator | agent`.
- An `actor: agent` state declares `path: <markdown-path>`.
- The `path` field on a state resolves directly to a markdown file in the same module-version bundle.
- An `actor: agent` state declares `resumable: true | false`.
- `resumable` declares whether the host should persist the state agent session and attempt resume when a record re-enters that same state later.
- If `resumable: true`, the state declares `session-field: <field-id>`.
- `session-field` identifies the frontmatter field where the host persists the resumable agent session id for that state.
- Delamain-declared `session-field` values do not need to appear in `shape.yaml` entity fields.
- Hosts append Delamain-declared session fields after the shape-declared frontmatter fields when materializing entity frontmatter.
- An `actor: agent` state may also declare `sub-agent: <markdown-path>`.
- `sub-agent` resolves directly to an auxiliary prompt asset in the same module-version bundle.
- Agent files are markdown files with YAML frontmatter plus a markdown body.
- The authored file shape intentionally mirrors Claude sub-agent files in this first draft.
- Delamain-local state agents are prompt assets. Their body prose is not interpreted semantically by the compiler in this pass.
- A state-bound agent is invoked because the record is currently in that state.
- The state-bound agent may choose among the legal outgoing transitions from that state.
- A declared `sub-agent` is an optional helper prompt the state agent may call while working that state.
- Transitions remain the legal outcome graph. Agents do not replace transitions.
- `actor: operator` states do not declare Delamain-local agent paths in this pass.
- This first draft keeps Delamain-local agents strongly coupled to one Delamain instead of introducing a standalone global agent catalog.

## Normative Effect

- Required: every `path` on an `actor: agent` state resolves to a markdown file in the same module-version bundle.
- Required: every resolved state-agent markdown file contains YAML frontmatter.
- Required: every resolved state-agent markdown file contains a non-empty markdown body after frontmatter.
- Required: state-agent markdown files declare frontmatter `name`.
- Required: state-agent markdown files declare frontmatter `description`.
- Required: terminal states do not declare `path`, `resumable`, `session-field`, or `sub-agent`.
- Required: if a state declares `path`, then that state declares `actor: agent`.
- Required: if a state declares `resumable`, then that state declares `actor: agent`.
- Required: `resumable` is boolean only.
- Required: every non-terminal `actor: agent` state declares `resumable`.
- Required: if `resumable: true`, the state declares exactly one `session-field`.
- Required: if `resumable: false`, the state does not declare `session-field`.
- Required: if a state declares `session-field`, then that state declares `actor: agent`.
- Required: if a state declares `sub-agent`, then that state declares `actor: agent`.
- Required: if a non-terminal state declares `actor: agent`, then that state declares exactly one `path`.
- Required: if a non-terminal state declares `actor: operator`, then that state does not declare `path`, `resumable`, `session-field`, or `sub-agent`.
- Required: `session-field` names are unique within one Delamain bundle.
- Required: Delamain-declared `session-field` names are treated as implicit nullable string frontmatter fields on entities bound to that Delamain.
- Required: if a state declares `sub-agent`, the referenced markdown file resolves in the same module-version bundle.
- Required: every resolved sub-agent markdown file contains YAML frontmatter.
- Required: every resolved sub-agent markdown file contains a non-empty markdown body after frontmatter.
- Required: sub-agent markdown files declare frontmatter `name`.
- Required: sub-agent markdown files declare frontmatter `description`.
- Required: Delamain transitions do not declare `actor`.
- Allowed: Delamain-local agent files may declare additional Claude-style frontmatter such as `tools`, `model`, or `color`.
- Allowed: resumable agent states may preserve their saved session field while work sits in operator-owned states and resume it on later re-entry to the same state.
- Allowed: a state agent may invoke its declared `sub-agent` while remaining the owner of the Delamain state transition.
- Allowed: a state-bound agent may choose any legal outgoing transition from its current state.
- Allowed: transitions keep their own ids and classes even when agents are bound to states.
- Rejected: transition-local `agent` bindings as the primary Delamain prompt surface in this pass.
- Rejected: a top-level Delamain `agents` registry in this draft surface.
- Rejected: requiring Delamain-declared `session-field` values to be explicitly duplicated in `shape.yaml`.
- Rejected: standalone module-level or system-level `agents` declarations in this pass.
- Rejected: interpreting prompt prose as part of Delamain graph validation in this pass.

## Compiler Impact

- Extend state parsing so states may declare `path`, `resumable`, optional `session-field`, and optional `sub-agent`.
- Add file-resolution and file-shape validation for state-agent markdown files, including required frontmatter and required `name` plus `description`.
- Add file-resolution and file-shape validation for referenced sub-agent markdown files.
- Add validation that terminal states do not declare `path`, `resumable`, `session-field`, or `sub-agent`.
- Add validation that `actor: agent` states declare exactly one `path` and explicit boolean `resumable`.
- Add validation that `resumable: true` states declare exactly one `session-field`.
- Add validation that `resumable: false` states do not declare `session-field`.
- Add validation that `actor: operator` states do not declare `path`, `resumable`, `session-field`, or `sub-agent`.
- Add validation that Delamain-declared `session-field` names are unique and are surfaced as implicit nullable string frontmatter fields after the shape-declared fields.
- Do not interpret prompt body semantics, tool lists, model selection, or instruction quality inside the compiler in this pass.

## Docs and Fixture Impact

- Update the canonical shape-language reference later to document state-level `path`, required `resumable`, optional `session-field`, path-valued optional `sub-agent`, and the Delamain-bundle file layout for prompt assets.
- Revise the `software-factory` design-reference example so its `delivery` Delamain declares direct state-level agent paths rather than a separate registry.
- Remove explicit planner and dev session fields from the fixture `shape.yaml` and let the Delamain declaration supply them implicitly.
- Add one Delamain-local agent markdown file per agent-owned state in that example.
- Add Delamain-local helper prompt assets under `sub-agents/` where the fixture needs to sketch a nested-agent pattern.
- Use the fixture to pressure-test naming, path layout, and how state-local prompt assets read when one state agent may choose among multiple legal transitions.
- Keep this fixture draft-focused. It does not need to prove runtime execution semantics yet.

## Alternatives Considered

- Keep transition-local agents from SDR 019.
- Rejected because dispatch is triggered by current state, while transition choice is an outcome of the work performed in that state.
- Keep a separate Delamain `agents` registry.
- Rejected because the current sketch is deliberately pushing authored paths down onto the states that own execution.
- Require session persistence fields to be explicitly duplicated in `shape.yaml`.
- Rejected because resumable session storage belongs to Delamain-owned execution semantics and should not force redundant field declarations in the base entity shape.
- Add a standalone top-level ALS `agents` construct first.
- Rejected because the current need is Delamain-local prompt assets whose reuse and independence are not yet proven.
- Resolve state agent files by naming convention from state ids.
- Rejected because the authored surface should keep the binding explicit and minimize hidden assumptions.
- Allow operator-owned states to declare Delamain-local agents too.
- Rejected because this draft is for autonomous prompt assets, while operator loops belong to later orchestrator-layer constructs.

## Open Questions

- Should Delamain-local agents later become a standalone ALS construct?
- Should state-bound agents remain Delamain-local, or should a later pass allow reusable agent templates?
- Should ALS later validate more of the Claude-style frontmatter contract beyond `name` and `description`?
- Should path-valued `sub-agent` remain Delamain-local, or grow into an explicit reusable registry later?
- Should Delamain later define explicit clearing semantics for saved session fields when work exits a resumable state permanently?
- Should Delamain eventually infer some transition metadata from states, or keep transitions fully explicit even when ownership lives on states?

## Non-Goals

- A general-purpose reusable agent catalog.
- Runtime execution semantics for how a host launches Delamain-local agents.
- Compiler judgment about whether a prompt is good, complete, or logically sound.
