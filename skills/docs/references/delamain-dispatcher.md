# Delamain Dispatcher Reference

The dispatcher is a generic Bun application template that scans entity items and invokes Delamain-bound agents via the Claude Agent SDK. Its runtime identity comes from a compiler-generated `runtime-manifest.json` projected into each deployed Delamain bundle.

## Audience

ALS Developer, ALS Architect, Claude.

## Overview

The dispatcher template lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/` and is copied into new Delamain bundles during module creation. Once copied, it runs without modification for any deployed Delamain bundle in any module.

The canonical template exposes its latest template version in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`. Every copied dispatcher bundle carries a local `dispatcher/VERSION` file. Startup reads both files, logs `[dispatcher] version: X (latest: Y)`, and appends `run /upgrade-dispatchers to update` when the local version is stale. Missing or malformed local or canonical `VERSION` files are hard startup errors.

When a Delamain bundle is deployed to `.claude/delamains/<name>/`, later `alsc deploy claude` runs preserve an existing `dispatcher/node_modules/` directory. Deploy itself does not install packages. If dependencies have never been installed in the deployed target, deploy warns and leaves installation as an explicit `bun install` step.

The deployed bundle root also receives `runtime-manifest.json`. That manifest is the authoritative binding contract for the runtime:

- which module mount path to scan
- which entity path template to match
- which frontmatter field is the Delamain-bound status field
- which discriminator field/value, if any, constrain the binding

The dispatcher is supported from deployed `.claude/delamains/<name>/` bundles. Running it directly from authored `.als/modules/.../delamains/.../dispatcher` is not part of the runtime contract because authored bundles do not carry the generated manifest.

## Telemetry Files

The dispatcher now emits two runtime surfaces per deployed Delamain bundle:

- `status.json` — the small compatibility heartbeat for liveness, PID checks, poll cadence, direct active dispatch count, scanned item count, and current delegated handoffs
- `telemetry/events.jsonl` — the bounded recent activity log for dashboard history

`telemetry/events.jsonl` is append-only at the contract level, but the writer keeps only the most recent bounded window of events so the file does not grow without limit. Each event is a single JSON object using schema `als-delamain-telemetry-event@1`.

Recent telemetry events include:

- dispatch start
- dispatch finish
- dispatch failure

Each event records the Delamain name, module id, item id, current state, agent identity, resume metadata, transition targets, duration, turn count, cost, and error text when present.

Older dispatcher copies that only emit `status.json` remain valid. Consumers must degrade to heartbeat-only mode instead of failing when `telemetry/events.jsonl` is absent.

## Source Files

### `src/index.ts`

Entry point. Handles:

- **System root discovery**: walks up directories from its own location looking for `.als/system.ts`. Also respects the `SYSTEM_ROOT` environment variable.
- **Template version check**: reads local `dispatcher/VERSION` and canonical `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`, logs the current/latest versions, and fails before polling when either source is missing or malformed.
- **Startup**: calls `resolve()` once to load `runtime-manifest.json`, local `delamain.yaml`, and state-agent files, then enters the poll loop.
- **Poll loop**: scans items at a configurable interval (`POLL_MS`, default 30s). Tracks direct dispatch ownership separately from delegated handoffs, releases either guard when the item's status changes, and refreshes the heartbeat after dispatch completions.
- **Runtime hardening**: keeps the event loop alive with an internal keepalive server, logs tick and process lifecycle events, and ignores stray `SIGTERM` so dispatcher children do not accidentally kill the parent runtime.

### `src/dispatch-lifecycle.ts`

Pure lifecycle helper for the poll loop:

- Tracks observed item statuses
- Separates direct active dispatch ownership from delegated handoffs
- Converts successful delegated launches into `delegated_items` heartbeat entries
- Releases stale guards when the item's status changes or when a late completion arrives after the item already moved on

### `src/watcher.ts`

Generic frontmatter parser and item scanner. Recursively walks the bound module root, matches concrete markdown file paths against the bound entity path template, and reads the Delamain-bound status field named in `runtime-manifest.json`.

### `src/dispatcher.ts`

The core logic. Two main functions:

**`resolve(bundleRoot, systemRoot)`** — loads the bundle-local runtime contract:

1. Reads `runtime-manifest.json` from the deployed Delamain bundle root
2. Reads local `delamain.yaml`
3. Loads state-agent and sub-agent markdown files from the same deployed bundle
4. Builds a dispatch table from `actor: agent` states

**`dispatch(itemId, itemFile, entry, agents, systemRoot)`** — invokes an agent:

1. Reads the agent's markdown file (frontmatter + body)
2. Composes the prompt: agent body + runtime context (item ID, current state, legal transitions)
3. Calls the Agent SDK `query()` directly with the agent's model, tools, and prompt
4. Handles direct and delegated session behavior: reads session metadata, resumes direct SDK sessions, and skips SDK resume plus auto-persist for delegated states
5. Passes sub-agents via the SDK `agents` parameter when the state declares `sub-agent`

### `src/runtime-manifest.ts`

Runtime manifest loader and validator.

- Reads `runtime-manifest.json` from the deployed bundle root
- Validates the manifest schema and required binding fields
- Fails closed with a redeploy message when the manifest is missing or malformed

### `src/dispatcher-version.ts`

Dispatcher template version loader and formatter.

- Reads local `dispatcher/VERSION` from the deployed bundle root
- Reads canonical latest version from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`
- Accepts positive integers only
- Formats the startup version line and stale-version upgrade instruction

### `src/session-runtime.ts`

Pure helper logic for session handling:

- Builds the runtime `resume`, `session_field`, and `session_id` contract from authored Delamain state data plus any stored session value
- Distinguishes direct SDK-resumable states from delegated externally managed worker sessions
- Centralizes the rule for whether the dispatcher should persist its own SDK session id

### `src/telemetry.ts`

Structured telemetry writer and reader.

- Resolves the deployed telemetry path at `telemetry/events.jsonl`
- Normalizes telemetry events under schema `als-delamain-telemetry-event@1`
- Serializes concurrent writes inside the dispatcher process
- Enforces bounded retention so only the most recent events remain on disk
- Lets downstream consumers detect heartbeat-only legacy dispatchers when the file is absent

## How Configuration Is Derived

The dispatcher reads one generated runtime manifest plus the local Delamain bundle:

| What | Derived from |
|------|-------------|
| Module path | `runtime-manifest.json` → `module_mount_path` |
| Entity path template | `runtime-manifest.json` → `entity_path` |
| Status field | `runtime-manifest.json` → `status_field` |
| Variant discriminator | `runtime-manifest.json` → `discriminator_field` + `discriminator_value` |
| Legal states | Delamain primary definition → `states` |
| Dispatch rules | States where `actor: agent` and `path` is declared |
| Agent prompts | Markdown files at delamain-relative `path` |
| Legal transitions | Delamain primary definition → `transitions` filtered by source state |
| Session handling | State `resumable` + `delegated` + `session-field` |
| Sub-agents | State `sub-agent` path |
| Local dispatcher template version | `dispatcher/VERSION` |
| Latest dispatcher template version | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION` |

Hosts generate `runtime-manifest.json` during Claude projection. One deployed Delamain bundle owns exactly one effective binding. Reusing the same Delamain name across multiple effective bindings is a deploy-planning error.

## Path Resolution

Agent paths in `delamain.yaml` resolve relative to the directory containing the Delamain primary definition file (the deployed bundle root), not relative to the module bundle root.

The `findSystemRoot` walk-up in `index.ts` makes the dispatcher work at any nesting depth under a deployed `.claude/delamains/<name>/` bundle.

## Dashboard Contract

`nfrith-repos/als/delamain-dashboard/` is the canonical monitoring consumer for dispatcher runtime state.

The dashboard service reads:

- `status.json` for liveness and current delegated handoffs
- `telemetry/events.jsonl` for recent run history and failures
- `runtime-manifest.json` for bundle identity and item binding
- `delamain.yaml` for phase and actor context
- current item files for queue state

The localhost web UI and the OpenTUI client both consume the same service snapshot. They do not each re-implement discovery or scan the filesystem independently.

## Session Handling

Session fields are implicit — they originate in authored `delamain.ts` and are projected into runtime `delamain.yaml`, not declared in `module.ts`.

### Direct resumable dispatch

States that declare `resumable: true` and omit `delegated` (or declare `delegated: false`) get automatic Agent SDK session persistence:

1. Before dispatch, the dispatcher reads the session field from item frontmatter.
2. If the stored value is a valid Agent SDK session id, it passes `resume: sessionId` to the SDK.
3. After a new SDK session completes, the dispatcher writes that SDK session id back to the item's frontmatter field.
4. On subsequent dispatches to the same state, the SDK session resumes where it left off.

### Delegated dispatch

States that declare `delegated: true` are treated as orchestrators for externally managed work:

1. The dispatcher still reads the authored `session-field` value when one exists.
2. The dispatcher exposes `session_field` and `session_id` in Runtime Context so the state agent can inspect or manage the delegated worker lifecycle.
3. The dispatcher does not pass `resume` to the Agent SDK for delegated states.
4. The dispatcher does not auto-persist the dispatcher-owned Agent SDK session id back into the item's `session-field`.

If a delegated state has no declared `session-field`, Runtime Context still includes `session_field: null` and `session_id: null`.

## Sub-Agent Handling

When a state declares `sub-agent: <path>`, the dispatcher:

1. Loads the sub-agent markdown file from the delamain-relative path.
2. Passes it via the SDK's `agents` parameter as a named agent definition.
3. Adds `Agent` to the parent agent's allowed tools so it can invoke the sub-agent.

The sub-agent does not choose transitions — only the parent state agent decides which transition to take.

## Running the Dispatcher

```bash
cd <delamain-bundle>/dispatcher
bun install
bun run src/index.ts
```

`bun install` is the bootstrap step for a new deployed dispatcher. It is not part of the normal redeploy contract once `dispatcher/node_modules/` already exists.

Environment variables:

- `SYSTEM_ROOT` — override the system root (optional; auto-detected by default)
- `POLL_MS` — polling interval in milliseconds (default: 30000)
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — installed ALS plugin root used to read the canonical dispatcher `VERSION` file (required)

If `dispatcher/VERSION`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, the canonical dispatcher `VERSION`, or `runtime-manifest.json` is missing or invalid, the dispatcher fails closed before polling. Stale but readable dispatcher versions continue running and instruct the operator to run `/upgrade-dispatchers`.

## Heartbeat Shape

`status.json` always keeps these compatibility fields:

- `name`
- `pid`
- `last_tick`
- `poll_ms`
- `active_dispatches`
- `items_scanned`

Delegation-aware dispatchers add:

- `delegated_dispatches` — current number of delegated items still owned by external workers
- `delegated_items` — array of `{ item_id, state, delegated_at }` objects for the live delegated handoffs

Older consumers that only read the compatibility fields remain valid.
