# Delamain Dispatcher Reference

The dispatcher is a generic Bun application template that scans entity items and invokes Delamain-bound agents through provider-native SDK adapters. Its runtime identity comes from a compiler-generated `runtime-manifest.json` projected into each deployed Delamain bundle.

Each dispatch now runs inside its own isolated git worktree. The dispatcher owns the full lifecycle: create worktree, rewrite the bound item path into that worktree, run the provider session with that worktree as `cwd`, auto-commit successful edits, serialize merge-back to the integration checkout, and preserve blocked or orphaned worktrees instead of silently dropping work.

## Audience

ALS Developer, ALS Architect, Claude.

## Overview

The dispatcher template lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/` and is copied into new Delamain bundles during module creation. Once copied, it runs without modification for any deployed Delamain bundle in any module.

The canonical template exposes its latest template version in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`. Every copied dispatcher bundle carries a local `dispatcher/VERSION` file. Startup reads both files, logs `[dispatcher] version: X (latest: Y)`, and appends `run /upgrade-dispatchers to update` when the local version is stale. Missing or malformed local or canonical `VERSION` files are hard startup errors.

Every dispatcher entrypoint begins with `import "./preflight.js";`. That sibling module deletes `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before the Anthropic SDK loads, which keeps plain `bun run src/index.ts` on Max-subscription routing instead of cached API-key billing. OpenAI-provider dispatches continue to use `CODEX_API_KEY`.

When a Delamain bundle is deployed to `.claude/delamains/<name>/`, later `alsc deploy claude` runs refresh `dispatcher/` from the canonical dispatcher template while preserving an existing `dispatcher/node_modules/` directory. Deploy itself does not install packages. If dependencies have never been installed in the deployed target, deploy warns and leaves installation as an explicit `bun install` step.

Dispatcher runtime fixes in the canonical template are not live until the next `alsc deploy claude` refreshes the deployed bundle copy.

The deployed bundle root also receives `runtime-manifest.json`. That manifest is the authoritative binding contract for the runtime:

- which module mount path to scan
- which entity path template to match
- which frontmatter field is the Delamain-bound status field
- which discriminator field/value, if any, constrain the binding
- which effective dispatch limits to apply for this bundle
- which repo-relative submodules, if any, should be mounted as nested worktrees inside the host worktree

Authored manifest-sidecar declarations come from an optional `runtime-manifest.config.json` at the Delamain bundle root:

- `submodules: string[]`
- `limits.maxTurns?: positive integer`
- `limits.maxBudgetUsd?: positive number`
- `submodules` values are repo-relative paths such as `nfrith-repos/als`
- `limits` are module-authored only in this release; there is no operator-local override layer yet

The dispatcher is supported from deployed `.claude/delamains/<name>/` bundles. Running it directly from authored `.als/modules/.../delamains/.../dispatcher` is not part of the runtime contract because authored bundles do not carry the generated manifest.

## Telemetry Files

The dispatcher now emits three runtime surfaces per deployed Delamain bundle:

- `status.json` — the small compatibility heartbeat for liveness, PID checks, poll cadence, active dispatch counts, provider breakdown, and scanned item count
- `runtime/worktree-state.json` — the current runtime registry for active, blocked, orphaned, and guarded dispatch ownership plus provider metadata
- `telemetry/events.jsonl` — the bounded recent activity log for dashboard history

`telemetry/events.jsonl` is append-only at the contract level, but the writer keeps only the most recent bounded window of events so the file does not grow without limit. Each event is a single JSON object using schema `als-delamain-telemetry-event@1`.

Recent telemetry events include:

- dispatch start
- worktree prepared
- dispatch finish
- dispatch failure
- merge success
- merge blocked
- cleanup

Each event records the Delamain name, module id, dispatch id, item id, current state, agent identity, resume metadata, worktree path and branch, merge outcome, transition targets, duration, turn count, cost, and error text when present.
Submodule-targeting events also carry `mounted_submodules`, which records each mounted repo path plus its dispatch branch name, mounted worktree path, and any worktree/integrated commit SHAs known at that point in the lifecycle.

Older dispatcher copies that only emit `status.json` remain valid. Consumers must degrade to heartbeat-only mode instead of failing when `telemetry/events.jsonl` is absent.

## Source Files

### `src/index.ts`

Entry point. Handles:

- **Auth preflight**: imports `src/preflight.ts` as the literal first line so the Anthropic SDK never sees `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` during module evaluation.
- **System root discovery**: walks up directories from its own location looking for `.als/system.ts`. Also respects the `SYSTEM_ROOT` environment variable.
- **Template version check**: reads local `dispatcher/VERSION` and canonical `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`, logs the current/latest versions, and fails before polling when either source is missing or malformed.
- **Startup**: calls `resolve()` once to load `runtime-manifest.json`, local `delamain.yaml`, and state-agent files, then enters the poll loop.
- **Effective limits**: resolves `runtime-manifest.json.limits` once at startup, falls back to canonical `50 / 10` when absent, and logs the active `maxTurns / maxBudgetUsd` pair before polling.
- **Runtime boot**: creates one `DispatcherRuntime`, runs orphan sweep at startup, and keeps the persisted dispatch registry as the source of truth for active, blocked, orphaned, and guarded ownership.
- **Poll loop**: scans items at a configurable interval (`POLL_MS`, default 30s). Reads committed `HEAD` state only, warns when a status transition exists in the checkout but not in `HEAD`, reconciles registry records against current item status, retries blocked `dirty_integration_checkout` merge-backs under the existing repo-mutation lease, suppresses redispatch for all other unresolved incidents, runs periodic orphan sweeping, and refreshes the heartbeat after dispatch completions.
- **Runtime hardening**: keeps the event loop alive with an internal keepalive server, logs tick and process lifecycle events, and ignores stray `SIGTERM` so dispatcher children do not accidentally kill the parent runtime.

### `src/preflight.ts`

Auth-strip shim.

- Deletes `process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before any SDK import executes
- Protects plain `bun run` entrypoints from the SDK's module-init auth capture
- Keeps the later `sdkEnv` clone aligned with the already-stripped process environment

### `src/dispatcher-runtime.ts`

Runtime coordinator for isolated dispatch execution.

- Creates per-dispatch worktrees
- Owns the persisted dispatch registry
- Finalizes successful and failed dispatches
- Holds the repo-mutation lease during merge-back
- Retries blocked dirty-tree merge-backs until the bounded ceiling, then escalates them to `primary_dirty_timeout`
- Produces heartbeat counts for active, blocked, orphaned, and guarded runtime state, including `active_by_provider`

### `src/dispatch-registry.ts`

Persistent registry over `runtime/worktree-state.json`.

- Stores the current dispatch/worktree owner for each item
- Survives dispatcher restarts
- Suppresses redispatch for blocked or orphaned incidents
- Releases guards when an item's status changes
- Preserves mounted submodule worktree metadata for active, blocked, and orphaned dispatches

### `src/git-worktree-isolation.ts`

Git-backed isolation strategy.

- Creates per-dispatch branches named `delamain/<dispatcher>/<item>/<dispatch-id>`
- Creates host worktrees under `~/.worktrees/delamain/<dispatcher>/<item>/<dispatch-id>/`
- Mounts any declared `runtime-manifest.json.submodules` as nested git worktrees at the same repo-relative paths inside that host worktree
- Rewrites bound item paths into the isolated workspace
- Auto-commits isolated worktrees into provisional single-commit snapshots, refreshes stale worktrees by merging current primary `HEAD` into the isolated checkout, fast-forwards mounted primaries first, pushes each mounted dispatch branch to the submodule `origin`, repoints the mounted checkout to the integrated SHA, then fast-forwards the host checkout to the refreshed worktree commit
- If a host refresh stops on `UU <submodule>` conflicts only, performs a narrow mechanical reconciliation by merging the conflicting submodule SHA inside each mounted checkout, staging the resolved gitlink back into the host worktree, and sealing the outer merge with the dispatcher signature message
- Blocks submodule-origin push failures as `submodule_push_failed`, preserving the host and mounted worktrees instead of landing an unreachable gitlink SHA
- Treats dirty integration checkouts as a retryable wait condition; once the operator cleans the tree, the poll loop re-runs refresh + merge-back under the same lease and escalates long-lived waits to `primary_dirty_timeout`
- Blocks concurrent-overlap refresh failures as `stale_base_conflict`, preserving the host and mounted worktrees for operator or agent-assist follow-up
- Rolls back already-integrated primary clones if a later repo in the merge transaction fails, leaving the host worktree and mounted submodule worktrees preserved for inspection

### `src/repo-mutation-lock.ts`

Cross-process integration lease.

- Serializes merge-back into the integration checkout
- Sweeps stale locks left by dead dispatcher processes

### `src/orphan-sweeper.ts`

Recovery helper for stale active dispatches.

- Removes pristine stale worktrees automatically
- Preserves dirty or committed stale worktrees as orphaned incidents
- Leaves operator-visible incident state instead of deleting ambiguous work

### `src/dispatch-lifecycle.ts`

Legacy in-memory lifecycle helper retained for compatibility tests. The persisted runtime registry is now the authoritative ownership mechanism.

### `src/watcher.ts`

Generic frontmatter parser and item scanner. Recursively walks the bound module root, matches concrete markdown file paths against the bound entity path template, and reads the Delamain-bound status field named in `runtime-manifest.json`.

### `src/dispatcher.ts`

The core logic. Two main functions:

**`resolve(bundleRoot, systemRoot)`** — loads the bundle-local runtime contract:

1. Reads `runtime-manifest.json` from the deployed Delamain bundle root
2. Reads local `delamain.yaml`
3. Loads state-agent and sub-agent markdown files from the same deployed bundle
4. Builds a dispatch table from `actor: agent` states

**`dispatch(itemId, itemFile, entry, agents, config, bundleRoot, runtime)`** — invokes an agent:

1. Claims a persisted dispatch slot and creates an isolated worktree
2. Rewrites the bound `item_file` into that worktree and adds worktree metadata to Runtime Context
3. Routes the dispatch through the state's declared provider adapter with the worktree as `cwd`
4. Handles provider-owned session behavior: reads session metadata, resumes Anthropic sessions or OpenAI threads when the state is resumable, and persists new provider session ids back to the item's `session-field`
5. Finalizes through the runtime: auto-commit worktree changes, merge back under the repo-mutation lease, clean up on success, or preserve blocked/orphaned worktrees when integration is unsafe

### `src/runtime-manifest.ts`

Runtime manifest loader and validator.

- Reads `runtime-manifest.json` from the deployed bundle root
- Validates the manifest schema and required binding fields
- Normalizes the optional `submodules` list to `[]` when absent
- Validates the optional `limits.maxTurns` and `limits.maxBudgetUsd` fields when present
- Fails closed with a redeploy message when the manifest is missing or malformed

### `src/dispatcher-version.ts`

Dispatcher template version loader and formatter.

- Reads local `dispatcher/VERSION` from the deployed bundle root
- Reads canonical latest version from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION`
- Accepts positive integers only
- Formats the startup version line and stale-version upgrade instruction

### `src/session-runtime.ts`

Pure helper logic for session handling:

- Builds the runtime `resume`, `session_field`, and `session_id` contract from authored Delamain state data plus any stored session value
- Treats stored session ids as opaque provider-owned identifiers
- Centralizes the rule for whether the dispatcher should persist the provider session id

### `src/telemetry.ts`

Structured telemetry writer and reader.

- Resolves the deployed telemetry path at `telemetry/events.jsonl`
- Normalizes telemetry events under schema `als-delamain-telemetry-event@1`
- Serializes concurrent writes inside the dispatcher process
- Enforces bounded retention so only the most recent events remain on disk
- Lets downstream consumers detect heartbeat-only legacy dispatchers when the file is absent

### `src/runtime-state.ts`

Shared reader/writer for `runtime/worktree-state.json`.

- Normalizes persisted dispatch/worktree records
- Lets dashboard consumers inspect current active, blocked, orphaned, and guarded state plus provider metadata
- Gives the dispatcher registry a single on-disk contract

## How Configuration Is Derived

The dispatcher reads one generated runtime manifest plus the local Delamain bundle:

| What | Derived from |
|------|-------------|
| Module path | `runtime-manifest.json` → `module_mount_path` |
| Entity path template | `runtime-manifest.json` → `entity_path` |
| Status field | `runtime-manifest.json` → `status_field` |
| Variant discriminator | `runtime-manifest.json` → `discriminator_field` + `discriminator_value` |
| Mounted nested repos | `runtime-manifest.json` → `submodules[]` |
| Effective dispatch limits | `runtime-manifest.json` → `limits.maxTurns` / `limits.maxBudgetUsd`, else dispatcher defaults `50 / 10` |
| Legal states | Delamain primary definition → `states` |
| Dispatch rules | States where `actor: agent` and `path` is declared |
| Agent prompts | Markdown files at delamain-relative `path` |
| Legal transitions | Delamain primary definition → `transitions` filtered by source state |
| Session handling | State `resumable` + `provider` + `session-field` |
| Sub-agents | State `sub-agent` path |
| Local dispatcher template version | `dispatcher/VERSION` |
| Latest dispatcher template version | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/new/references/dispatcher/VERSION` |

Hosts generate `runtime-manifest.json` during Claude projection. One deployed Delamain bundle owns exactly one effective binding. Reusing the same Delamain name across multiple effective bindings is a deploy-planning error.

This ship does not add any operator-local limit override layer. Limit changes are authored in module source and take effect on the next deploy plus dispatcher restart.

## Path Resolution

Agent paths in `delamain.yaml` resolve relative to the directory containing the Delamain primary definition file (the deployed bundle root), not relative to the module bundle root.

The `findSystemRoot` walk-up in `index.ts` makes the dispatcher work at any nesting depth under a deployed `.claude/delamains/<name>/` bundle.

## Dashboard Contract

`nfrith-repos/als/delamain-dashboard/` is the canonical monitoring consumer for dispatcher runtime state.

The dashboard service reads:

- `status.json` for liveness and provider-aware active-dispatch counts
- `runtime/worktree-state.json` for active worktree ownership plus blocked/orphaned incidents, including any mounted submodule worktrees
- `telemetry/events.jsonl` for recent run history and failures
- `runtime-manifest.json` for bundle identity and item binding
- `delamain.yaml` for phase and actor context
- current item files for queue state

The localhost web UI and the OpenTUI client both consume the same service snapshot. They do not each re-implement discovery or scan the filesystem independently.

## Session Handling

Session fields are implicit — they originate in authored `delamain.ts` and are projected into runtime `delamain.yaml`, not declared in `module.ts`.

### Provider-owned resumable dispatch

States that declare `resumable: true` get automatic provider session persistence:

1. Before dispatch, the dispatcher reads the session field from item frontmatter.
2. If the stored value is a non-empty provider session id, it passes that value to the provider adapter as the resume target.
3. After a new provider session or thread completes, the dispatcher writes that session id back to the item's frontmatter field.
4. On subsequent dispatches to the same state, the provider session resumes where it left off.

`session_id` is intentionally opaque. Anthropic currently stores SDK session ids; OpenAI stores Codex thread ids.

## Sub-Agent Handling

When a state declares `sub-agent: <path>`, the dispatcher:

1. Loads the sub-agent markdown file from the delamain-relative path.
2. Passes it via the SDK's `agents` parameter as a named agent definition.
3. Adds `Agent` to the parent agent's allowed tools so it can invoke the sub-agent.

The sub-agent does not choose transitions — only the parent state agent decides which transition to take.

## Running the Dispatcher

```bash
cd <delamain-bundle>/dispatcher
bun install
bun run src/index.ts
```

`bun install` is the bootstrap step for a new deployed dispatcher. It is not part of the normal redeploy contract once `dispatcher/node_modules/` already exists.

Environment variables:

- `SYSTEM_ROOT` — override the system root (optional; auto-detected by default)
- `POLL_MS` — polling interval in milliseconds (default: 30000)
- `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` — installed ALS plugin root used to read the canonical dispatcher `VERSION` file (required)

If `dispatcher/VERSION`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, the canonical dispatcher `VERSION`, or `runtime-manifest.json` is missing or invalid, the dispatcher fails closed before polling. Stale but readable dispatcher versions continue running and instruct the operator to run `/upgrade-dispatchers`.

## Heartbeat Shape

`status.json` always keeps these compatibility fields:

- `name`
- `pid`
- `last_tick`
- `poll_ms`
- `active_dispatches`
- `items_scanned`

Provider-aware dispatchers add:

- `blocked_dispatches` — current count of blocked merge or cleanup incidents
- `orphaned_dispatches` — current count of preserved orphaned worktrees
- `guarded_dispatches` — current count of successful same-state runs still guarded against redispatch
- `active_by_provider` — object with active counts per provider, currently `{ anthropic, openai }`

Older consumers that only read the compatibility fields remain valid.
