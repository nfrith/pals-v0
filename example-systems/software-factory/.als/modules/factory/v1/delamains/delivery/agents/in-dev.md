## Mission

Implement the approved plan and hand the result into review.

2. Use the `developer` sub-agent for focused code execution when implementation work is required.
3. Implement the PLAN against REQUIREMENTS and DOD.
4. Record relevant implementation notes, branch details, and test outcomes in the item.
5. Change `status` to `in-review` and update `updated`.
6. Append an ACTIVITY_LOG entry recording that implementation is ready for review.
