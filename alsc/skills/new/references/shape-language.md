# ALS Shape Language Reference

This is the complete format specification for ALS v1 shape files and system configuration. Use this reference when producing YAML output.

## system.yaml

Lives at `.als/system.yaml`. Declares the system identity and module registry.

```yaml
als_version: 1                      # active ALS language version for the whole system
system_id: my-system                  # unique system identifier used in ref URIs

modules:
  people:                             # module id, kebab-case
    path: workspace/people            # module mount path relative to the system root
    version: 1                        # currently deployed shape version
    skills:                           # active skill ids for the active module version
      - people-module
```

Rules:
- `als_version`: required positive integer. One system validates against one ALS language version at a time.
- This compiler currently supports `als_version: 1` only.
- ALS language-version upgrades are whole-system cutovers. Long-lived mixed ALS versions inside one system are not part of the v1 contract.
- `system_id`: non-empty string, used in ref URIs
- Module ids must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Module `path` is a normalized relative path from the system root made of one or more slash-separated slug segments
- Each `path` segment must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Module `skills` is a required array of module-local skill ids and may be empty
- Each skill id must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Module paths cannot be absolute, contain empty segments, contain `.` or `..`, or contain hidden segments like `.pals`
- The module's data lives at `{path}/`
- The module subtree may contain reserved non-record markdown files named `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at any depth
- Matching for reserved agent files is case-insensitive, including the `.md` extension
- Reserved agent files are ignored during ALS record validation and do not need entity path matches
- Reserved agent files are the only case-insensitive markdown filename exception in module discovery
- Other markdown files must use lowercase `.md`; non-reserved files like `README.MD` are invalid
- Other markdown files in the module subtree remain subject to normal ALS discovery and validation rules
- Validation fails cleanly if ALS cannot read a directory inside the module subtree during discovery
- The declared `path` must exist as a directory when validating
- No two modules may have identical or overlapping mount paths
- Module versions are directory bundles at `.als/modules/{module_id}/v{version}/`
- Active shape files are inferred at `.als/modules/{module_id}/v{version}/shape.yaml`
- A module declared at `version: N` must have contiguous bundle history from `v1` through `vN`
- Bundles above the active version may exist for staged future work and are ignored by default validation
- If `skills` is non-empty, the active bundle must contain `skills/{skill_id}/SKILL.md` for every listed skill id
- If `skills` is empty, the active bundle may omit `skills/` entirely
- Unlisted skill directories under the active bundle's `skills/` directory are invalid
- Extra files inside a listed skill directory are allowed
- Every bundle `vK` where `K > 1` must contain `migrations/MANIFEST.md` plus at least one additional migration artifact
- Authored ALS v1 source YAML does not include a top-level `schema` field.
- Validators reject stale authored `schema` fields so removed syntax does not linger in systems or prompts.

## Module version bundle

Lives at `.als/modules/{module_id}/v{version}/`.

```yaml
dependencies:                         # other modules this one references
  - module: people                    # just the module id

entities:
  # ... entity definitions
```

Rules:
- Every required module version bundle contains `shape.yaml`
- The active skill interface is declared in `.als/system.yaml`, but the canonical skill bundles live under `skills/{skill_id}/SKILL.md`
- Migration assets for `vK > 1` live under `migrations/` in the target bundle `vK`
- `dependencies`: list modules whose entities are referenced by this module's ref fields. If a ref targets another module, that module must be listed here.
- `entities`: keyed by entity name matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Authored ALS v1 shape files do not include a top-level `schema` field.
- Validators reject stale authored `schema` fields so removed syntax does not linger in systems or prompts.

## Entity definition

Entities have two supported shapes:

1. Plain entities with a shared `fields` set and an explicit `body` contract
2. Variant entities with root/base `fields`, a `discriminator`, an optional shared `body`, a `section_definitions` library, and per-variant `fields` + full ordered `sections`

### Plain entity

```yaml
entity-name:
  path: items/{id}.md                 # path template relative to module data dir

  identity:
    id_field: id                      # always "id"
    parent:                           # optional — only for nested entities
      entity: parent-entity-name      # must be another entity in this module
      ref_field: parent_ref           # field in this entity that refs the parent

  fields:
    # ... field definitions

  body:
    title:
      source:
        kind: field
        field: title

    preamble:
      allow_null: true
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          paragraph: {}
      guidance:
        include: framing context before the main sections
        exclude: section-specific detail

    sections:
      # ... inline section definitions
```

### Variant entity

```yaml
entity-name:
  path: items/{id}.md

  identity:
    id_field: id

  discriminator: type

  fields:                             # root/base fields present for every variant
    id:
      type: id
      allow_null: false
    title:
      type: string
      allow_null: false
    type:
      type: enum
      allow_null: false
      allowed_values: [app, research]

  body:                               # optional shared top-level body regions
    title:
      source:
        kind: field
        field: title
    preamble:
      allow_null: true
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          paragraph: {}

  section_definitions:                # reusable h2 section definitions keyed by section name
    DESCRIPTION:
      allow_null: false
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          paragraph: {}
      guidance:
        include: what this item is and why it exists
        exclude: status history
    ACTIVITY_LOG:
      allow_null: false
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          bullet_list: {}
          ordered_list: {}
      guidance:
        include: dated progress history
        exclude: evergreen requirements

  variants:
    app:
      fields:                         # variant-local fields added to the root/base set
        status:
          type: enum
          allow_null: false
          allowed_values: [draft, active, completed]
      sections: [DESCRIPTION, ACTIVITY_LOG]   # authoritative full h2 section order for app records

    research:
      fields:
        status:
          type: enum
          allow_null: false
          allowed_values: [draft, findings-ready, completed]
      sections: [DESCRIPTION, ACTIVITY_LOG]
```

Rules:
- Plain entities declare their full body contract in `body`.
- Variant entities continue to use `section_definitions` plus each variant's `sections` list for authoritative `h2` section order.
- Variant entities may also declare shared `body.title` and shared `body.preamble` at the entity root.
- Variant entities may omit `body` entirely when they do not declare a shared title or shared preamble.

### Path templates

Path templates use `{placeholder}` segments to map entities to filesystem paths.

- `{id}` captures this entity's id
- `{parent_entity_name}` captures an ancestor's id (use the entity name, not the field name)
- Every path must contain `{id}`
- Nested entities should include ancestor placeholders to encode lineage

Examples:
- Flat: `items/{id}.md`
- Self-named directory: `items/{id}/{id}.md`
- Nested: `programs/{program}/experiments/{id}/{id}.md`
- Deeply nested: `programs/{program}/experiments/{experiment}/runs/{id}.md`

### Field types

Every entity must declare an `id` field of type `id`. Every declared field must appear in record frontmatter. `allow_null` controls whether the explicit value may be `null`; it does not allow omission.

There is no mechanism to declare optional fields.

#### id

```yaml
id:
  type: id
  allow_null: false
```

Primary key. Must be a non-empty string. Must match the filename stem.
The compiler rejects `allow_null: true` on `id`.

#### string

```yaml
title:
  type: string
  allow_null: false
```

#### number

```yaml
budget:
  type: number
  allow_null: true
```

#### date

```yaml
started_on:
  type: date
  allow_null: false
```

Values must be `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

#### enum

```yaml
status:
  type: enum
  allow_null: false
  allowed_values: [draft, active, completed]
```

Must include `allowed_values` — a list of at least one string.

#### ref

```yaml
owner_ref:
  type: ref
  allow_null: true
  target:
    module: people          # target module id
    entity: person          # target entity name
```

Ref values in record frontmatter use the format: `"[display-label](als://system_id/module/entity/ancestor/.../id)"`

The URI path encodes the full lineage: `als://system_id/module/entity-type/entity-id` for root entities, or `als://system_id/module/parent-type/parent-id/child-type/child-id` for nested entities.

- `target.module` can be this module or another module (if another, it must be in `dependencies`)

#### list

```yaml
tags:
  type: list
  allow_null: true
  items:
    type: string
```

Items can be `type: string` or `type: ref` (with a `target`):

```yaml
people:
  type: list
  allow_null: true
  items:
    type: ref
    target:
      module: people
      entity: person
```

### Body regions

`body` is the explicit top-level body contract for a record. It may declare:

- `title`: the record `h1`
- `preamble`: top-level content between the `h1` and the first declared `h2`, or before the first `h2` when no title is declared
- `sections`: the ordered `h2` regions for plain entities

Every authored top-level body region must be declared. There are no invisible body zones.
For plain entities, `body.sections` must be a non-empty ordered list.

#### Title region

Field-bound title:

```yaml
body:
  title:
    source:
      kind: field
      field: title
```

Authored title:

```yaml
body:
  title:
    source:
      kind: authored
```

Templated title:

```yaml
body:
  title:
    source:
      kind: template
      parts:
        - kind: field
          field: id
        - kind: literal
          value: " "
        - kind: field
          field: title
```

Rules:
- `body.title` is optional.
- If `body.title` is declared, the record must contain exactly one `h1`.
- There is no implicit `title == id` rule.
- `source.kind` must be one of `field`, `authored`, or `template`.
- `field` sources must reference a declared field of type `id` or `string` with `allow_null: false`.
- `authored` means the `h1` text is authored directly in the record body and is not matched to a field.
- `template.parts` must be a non-empty ordered list.
- Template parts must be either:
  - `{ kind: field, field: <field_name> }`
  - `{ kind: literal, value: <string> }`
- Field parts use the same field restrictions as `source.kind: field`.
- The rendered field or template value must match the authored `h1` text exactly.

#### Region definitions

`body.preamble`, inline `body.sections` entries, `section_definitions` values, and `outline.preamble` all use the same region-definition shape.

```yaml
preamble:
  allow_null: false
  content:
    mode: freeform
    blocks:
      paragraph: {}
  guidance:
    include: what belongs here
    exclude: what does not belong here
```

```yaml
- name: DESCRIPTION
  allow_null: false
  content:
    mode: freeform
    blocks:
      paragraph: {}
  guidance:
    include: what belongs here
    exclude: what does not belong here
```

Rules:
- `allow_null`: if true, the region may contain the literal word `null` instead of authored Markdown content.
- `content`: required content contract.
- `guidance`: optional authoring hints.
- If `guidance` is present, `include` and `exclude` are optional non-empty strings.
- Inline `body.sections` entries must declare `name`, rendered as `## NAME` in the markdown file.
- `section_definitions` keys are section names for variant entities and render as `## SECTION_NAME`.
- Every declared section must appear in the record body.
- Sections must appear in the same order they are declared by the shape.
- No duplicate section names within an entity.

#### Content contracts

Every non-title body region declares a `content` contract with exactly one mode:

- `mode: freeform`
- `mode: outline`

##### Freeform content

```yaml
content:
  mode: freeform
  blocks:
    paragraph:
      min_count: 1
    bullet_list:
      max_items: 8
    table:
      syntax: gfm
    heading:
      min_depth: 3
      max_depth: 4
    blockquote: {}
    code:
      require_language: true
```

Rules:
- `blocks` must declare at least one block type.
- Supported block types in the current v1 body contract are:
  - `paragraph`
  - `bullet_list`
  - `ordered_list`
  - `table`
  - `heading`
  - `blockquote`
  - `code`
- `{}` means the block type is allowed with no extra constraints.
- Supported block options in the current v1 body contract are:
  - `paragraph.min_count` / `paragraph.max_count`
  - `blockquote.min_count` / `blockquote.max_count`
  - `bullet_list.min_items` / `bullet_list.max_items`
  - `ordered_list.min_items` / `ordered_list.max_items`
  - `table.syntax`
  - `heading.min_depth` / `heading.max_depth`
  - `code.require_language`
- Phrasing-level validation is only partially enforced by the compiler in current v1.
- The compiler intentionally rejects raw HTML and reference-style syntax, but it does not exhaustively validate every other inline node.
- Authored records in current v1 currently use this inline markdown subset:
  - plain text
  - `strong`
  - `emphasis`
  - `inlineCode`
  - inline links
  - inline images
  - hard line breaks
- Reference-style links and reference-style images are not supported in current v1.
- Markdown `definition` nodes are not supported in current v1.
- Raw HTML is not allowed anywhere in ALS v1 record bodies, including inside paragraphs, headings, and other phrasing content.
- Thematic breaks such as `---`, `***`, and `___` are not supported in current v1.
- `table.syntax` is required and must currently be `gfm`.
- ALS v1 table support currently means GitHub Flavored Markdown pipe tables.
- Current GFM table limits are part of the ALS v1 contract:
  - one header row
  - one delimiter row
  - zero or more body rows
  - inline markdown only inside cells
  - no multiline cell blocks
  - no headerless tables
  - no row spans or column spans
- HTML tables and other markdown table dialects are not part of the current v1 body contract.
- In top-level `body.preamble` and top-level `body.sections[*]` regions, structural heading depth is `2`: `h1` is reserved for the declared title and `h2` is reserved for declared sections.
- Because of that structural depth, freeform `heading` content in those top-level regions can only match `h3` or deeper.

##### Outline content

```yaml
content:
  mode: outline
  preamble:
    allow_null: false
    content:
      mode: freeform
      blocks:
        paragraph:
          min_count: 1
  nodes:
    - heading:
        depth: 3
        text: Detection
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          bullet_list: {}
    - heading:
        depth: 3
        text: Recovery Lead Notes
      content:
        mode: freeform
        blocks:
          blockquote: {}
```

Rules:
- `outline.preamble` is optional.
- `outline.preamble` uses the same exact region-definition shape as `body.preamble`.
- `nodes` must be a non-empty ordered list.
- Each node must declare:
  - `heading.depth`
  - `heading.text`
  - `content`
- `heading.depth` is explicit and exact.
- In current v1, outline nodes are ordered, required, and exact.
- In current v1, outline does not define optional nodes, repeated nodes, or other cardinality syntax.
- `node.content` currently uses `mode: freeform`.
- If a node's freeform content allows headings, those headings must be deeper than that node's declared `heading.depth`.
- Use `outline` when the heading tree itself is part of the schema contract.
- Use `freeform` when headings are allowed but their exact labels and order are not declared by the schema.

### Variant section definitions

Variant entities define reusable `h2` section contracts in `section_definitions` and then reference them by name from each variant.

```yaml
section_definitions:
  DESCRIPTION:
    allow_null: false
    content:
      mode: freeform
      blocks:
        paragraph: {}
    guidance:
      include: what this item is and why it exists
      exclude: historical updates

variants:
  app:
    fields:
      status:
        type: enum
        allow_null: false
        allowed_values: [draft, active, completed]
    sections: [DESCRIPTION, ACTIVITY_LOG]
```

Rules:
- `discriminator` must point to a root/base field that is `type: enum` and `allow_null: false`.
- Variant keys form a bijection with the discriminator enum values: every enum value needs a variant, and extra variant keys are invalid.
- Variant-local field names cannot collide with root/base field names.
- Every section name referenced by a variant must exist in `section_definitions`.
- A variant's `sections` list is the authoritative full `h2` section order for records of that variant.
- Shared `body.title` and shared `body.preamble`, when declared, apply to every variant of the entity.
- If the discriminator is missing, non-string, or invalid, the compiler emits `PAL-RV-FM-008`, validates only root/base fields, emits `PAL-RV-BODY-004` for the body, and does not guess variant-specific fields or body sections.

## Naming rules and conventions

- Module ids, entity names, and skill ids are compiler-enforced single-segment slugs matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`
- Module mount paths are slash-separated slug segments using that same segment regex
- Field names are compiler-enforced and must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`
- `system_id` can be any non-empty string; `kebab-case` is recommended but not enforced
- Section names can be any non-empty string; `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` is recommended
- Record ids: any non-empty string, but must match filename stem

## What a record file looks like

A record is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter, a validated body title when declared, optional declared preamble content, and headed sections:

```markdown
---
id: ITEM-001
title: Example item
type: app
status: active
owner_ref: "[jane](als://my-system/people/person/PPL-001)"
---

# Example item

Short framing paragraph before the declared sections.

## DESCRIPTION

This is the description content.

## ACTIVITY_LOG

- 2026-03-17: Created the example record.
```

- If `body.title` is declared, the `# Title` heading after frontmatter is validated according to `title.source`
- Each declared frontmatter field must appear explicitly, using YAML `null` when `allow_null: true` and no value is available
- If `body.preamble` is declared, authored content before the first declared `##` belongs to that preamble region
- Each declared section appears as `## SECTION_NAME` in the order declared by the shape
- Nullable body regions with no content use the literal word `null`
- Empty string is not a valid value for `type: string` fields
